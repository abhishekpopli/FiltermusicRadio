        and play only music; you won\'t find a radio here where people having lenghty discussions
        (just in case these are the radio stations you are especially looking for, some can be found at the \"Various/Independent\" section).\n
        All streams presented have been filtered especially for electronic &amp; dance music from thousands of stations all over the Internet.</string>
